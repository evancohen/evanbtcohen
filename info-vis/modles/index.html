          I chose this text model because I like the contrasting fonts and colors. I feel that they will match well with my topic. The tall blocky texy is both new-age and fun. I'm am not yet sure if this will become my base model.

          <h4>Critique <span class="label label-success">1</span></h4>
          <p>Well emulated graphics! I'm a little confused about the box around the graphic on the left, why is it there? What is it's purpose?<p>
          <p>You should move the text to the left of the shoe for the second graphic to concerve space, and the space between "Cool Shoe" and "this is..." is too large (although upon a second glance it's fine).</p>

          <p>You might consider using some opacity in either of the graphics.</p>

          <p>The one on the right is better because of it's simplicity and openness.
          </p>
          <p><strong>Changes made baised on critique:</strong> Moved the text to the left of the shoe for the second representation. Marginally decreased the space between lines of text.</p>

          <h4>Critique <span class="label label-success">2</span></h4>
          <p>I see two cool high healed shoes, one hospital green and the other a grey silluette.</p>
          
          <p>Each graphic has the same profile, but different colors, text positioning, and alignment (integrated vs. seperated text)</p>

          <p>I like the larger size of the grey graphic, but the color of the graphic on the left. The larger size makes it more apperent of what it actually is.</p>
          <p><strong>Changes made baised on critique:</strong> Increased the size of the graphic on the left.</p>

          <p>I see a shoe! The simplicity is nice, but what are you trying to show? The graphic on the right has more text, and therefore more info, which I like.</p>

          <p>The color scheme is good, and the right contrasts with the background better.</p>

          <p>The border on the left could be a thinner stroke, rite now it draws attention to the border rather than the graphic itself.</p>

          <p>Overall the one on the left is better.</p>
          <p><strong>Changes made baised on critique:</strong> Decreased the stroke size for the left graphic and added more text.</p>

        <img src="/info-vis/images/apperance-1-r.png" alt="Color Model" />
        <p class="well">The actual emulation I am going with is on the left (I chose to include the other because there were very minimal modification made). I increased the size of the shoe in order to make it more distinguishable, and also moved it to the right in order to make more space for text. The last thing that I did was to tile the background that I pulled from the original graphic, because it was getting blurry. I think I did well integrating the feedback that I recieved and am very happy with this result. </p>

          <h4>Critique <span class="label label-success">1</span></h4>
          <p>No text inside box.
            Left one is too crowded.
            Invading the shoes space. 
            Prefer left. Older model. simpler. centered. less cluttered.
            Similar ammounts of text. Before the left shoe had less text. </p>

            good Integrated text, good weight on outlign

            Left is better. Compatmentalized is organised/pulled together

            Text is too close to the shoe. go away text.
            Colors are good. 
            A lot better than the first ones. 
            Background is "graphines"??? <- cool

          <p class="well text-left">I made some pretty significant changes based on the feedback that I recieved from my peers in terms of my number display. First off, I wasn't emulating my model enough, so I added dashes and fixed some more colors. I also made the names easier to read (human readable vs repository name). I also changed the data source to be something a little more meaninngful in terms of what it reperesents. I emulated my text model by using a tall font for the title, and smaller skinny font for the names and numbers. I played around with using some cursive, but that didn't fit very well.</p>
          <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Critique <span class="label label-success">1</span></h4>
          <p>I see data from 2005 to 2012, the axis list 3 months from each year. I'm not sure why there is -3000? I like how the data is stacked. You should fix the font to emulate your text model. Why is the data not sequential? Nice colors.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Critique <span class="label label-success">2</span></h4>
          <p>You matched the color model well. I like the rotated labes even though they don't conform to the base model. You may want to not use a grid as a background. That's a lot of data, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be seeing. The colors are spot on. You should match your font to that of the first model. It works really well overall.</p>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h4>Critique <span class="label label-success">2</span></h4>
          <p>The dashed lines look awesome, they are not too distracting to overwhelm the data. Way more data than your previous graphs, so I can see better patterns and trends. The lines added/removed are stacked and that's a little confusing. The slanted text makes it easier to read but makes the positioning kinda weird, you should try using horizontal. The background grid is very subtle, and keeps things interesting.</p>
