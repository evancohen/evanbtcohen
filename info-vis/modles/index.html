I increased the size of the shoe in order to make it more distinguishable, and also moved it to the right in order to make more space for text.

          <p class="well text-left">I made some pretty significant changes based on the feedback that I recieved from my peers in terms of my number display. First off, I wasn't emulating my model enough, so I added dashes and fixed some more colors. I also made the names easier to read (human readable vs repository name). I also changed the data source to be something a little more meaninngful in terms of what it reperesents. I emulated my text model by using a tall font for the title, and smaller skinny font for the names and numbers. I played around with using some cursive, but that didn't fit very well.</p>

          <h4>Critique <span class="label label-success">1</span></h4>
          <p>I see data from 2005 to 2012, the axis list 3 months from each year. I'm not sure why there is -3000? I like how the data is stacked. You should fix the font to emulate your text model. Why is the data not sequential? Nice colors.</p>

          <p>You matched the color model well. I like the rotated labes even though they don't conform to the base model. You may want to not use a grid as a background. That's a lot of data, I'm not sure what I'm supposed to be seeing. The colors are spot on. You should match your font to that of the first model. It works really well overall.</p>

          <p>The dashed lines look awesome, they are not too distracting to overwhelm the data. Way more data than your previous graphs, so I can see better patterns and trends. The lines added/removed are stacked and that's a little confusing. The slanted text makes it easier to read but makes the positioning kinda weird, you should try using horizontal. The background grid is very subtle, and keeps things interesting.</p>

            What is it of? Add a title... Lables would be nice. Some more context.
            Contrast is not strong enough to convey meaning. With the exception of CA it all looks the same. Emulates model colors, but model has more simple shapes... Map is very high fidelity. Needs better contrast!
            <br>
            <strong>Numbers</strong>
            Lines added and lines removed, pretty clearly coding. Color scheme. Cursive key is not a great idea. Maybe the title? Very legible, shows a great relationship between values. X-axis is a little crowded.</p>

          Like the cursive font. Stacking values. Good emulation (dashed lines, colors).
          X-axis is confusing, make it more space. Actually spell out the dates instead of using numbers.
          <br>
          <strong>Map</strong>
          More contrasting color. Add a title (we need more context). The first one is better than the second, because the second one makes it difficult to actually pinpoint where it is. You'd nee some kind of overlay, like a light outline of the states.</p>

            It's so cool how it goes under. Oh gosh. Increase the size and placement of key (under the title). The cursive font is weird. Oldest should go first (like a timeline)! The background and dashed axes are fantastic. Identical emulation.
            <br>
            <strong>Map</strong>
            What is an active institution? Use stepped colors. Or just anything not grey (for better contrast).
            Data by city is cool. Even without the map you can tell what it is by the general shape. Less cities, bigger circles. Delete the smaller data points.</p>

        Branching and Merging
        Why are some of the lines? Maybe use a legend?

        Show some kind of visual connection from the rebased branch to the applied branch.

        Create a key (for commits). Maybe the time could be done differently (different X-axis).
        The height of the arms is strange, why are they different? Black on the bottom (change to white). Are there better ways to represent this data?

        Can you do a clock?

        Super cool! Pretty simple, should have a title. So cool. The tick marks are a little strange. Can you remove them or do something else. The small bubbles get lost.

        Branching and merging

        Turn it so the head is at the bottom. Should be going down as you commit!
